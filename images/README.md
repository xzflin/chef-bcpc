# BCPC Image Builds

BCPC utilizes [Packer](http://packer.io) for building boxes to be used
by VirtualBox.  These boxes are used to provide machine images similar
to that of a PXE-booted bare metal machine.

## Installing Packer

http://www.packer.io/docs/installation.html


## Build Your Own Boxes

First, install [Packer](http://packer.io) and then clone this project.

Inside the `images/packer` directory, a JSON file describes each box
that can be built.  You can use `packer build` to build the boxes.

    $ packer build bcpc-bootstrap.json

Congratulations!  You now have box(es) in the ../build directory that
you can import into VirtualBox and start deploying your own Bloomberg
Clustered Private Cloud.

## Import Your Built Box

Inside the `images` directory, you can use `VBoxManage import` the built box.

    $ VBoxManage import build/virtualbox/bcpc-bootstrap/packer-bcpc-bootstrap_ubuntu-14.04-amd64.ova --vsys 0 --vmname bcpc-bootstrap

The vbox_create.sh script will do this for as part of the normal build
process if you define ARCHIVED_BOOTSTRAP to point to the .ova file
built by this.

Alternatively within the VirtualBox Manager, you can import the
machine via `File > Import Appliance...`


## Known Issues

* https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/debian-installer/+bug/568704

    When setting mirror/http/proxy on the command line, it prevents
    the preseed.cfg being fetched due to the http_proxy environment
    variable set.
