# USAGE:
# - do NOT set bcpc.enabled.apt_dist_upgrade or bcpc.enabled.apt_upgrade
#   in the Chef environment, allow this playbook to handle it
# - this playbook will orchestrate RabbitMQ/Erlang upgrades with the assumption
#   that both are being upgraded to versions that would break the RabbitMQ cluster
# - after upgrading Rabbit, Chef will be run to orchestrate cluster software upgrade
# - after Chef, dist-upgrade will be run to upgrade all remaining packages
# - use hardware_management/restart-target-nodes.yml to reboot cluster nodes in a
#   controlled fashion
