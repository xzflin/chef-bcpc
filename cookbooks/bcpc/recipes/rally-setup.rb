# the needed steps here...

# (1) - Install
# This was done during 'build_bins.sh' with the package build and then the 'rally.rb' recipe on the bootstrap node.
# It basically creates rally and rally-manage and puts them into the /usr/local/bin directory using pbr.

# (2) - Configure
# Inits the db. If a db already exists then this command will init back to an empty-clean state

# (3) - Deployment Configuration
# This step is very important since it reads (can also use environment variables) the json file that was
# created in an earlier part of this recipe.

# Note: The returns in this block can be pass or fail because it attempts to set the initial deployment up but if the
# head nodes are not responding then it will fail and will have to be ran again after the head nodes are up.
