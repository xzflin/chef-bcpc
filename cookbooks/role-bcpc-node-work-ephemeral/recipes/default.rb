# this is a hack to force nodes with this role cookbook into ephemeral mode
# (I am going to reconstruct things later to naturally Just Work for nodes
# that are using this role cookbook - erhudy)
node.override['bcpc']['nova']['ephemeral'] = true

# save the node at the start of the run so that its run list is available
node.save
# magic sleep so that Chef server has time to reindex
sleep 2
